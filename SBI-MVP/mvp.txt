✅ MVP = Minimum Viable Product
👉 Definition (Simple Language)

An MVP is the smallest and simplest version of a product that has just enough features for users to try it and give feedback.

You don't build the full product.
You build the basic working version first.

🎯 Why do we use MVP?

Because:

✔️ Save time
✔️ Save money
✔️ Test the idea early
✔️ Know what users actually want
✔️ Improve based on real feedback

MVP stands for Minimum Viable Product.
 It is a basic,
  functional version of a product
   with only essential features, 
   built to test the idea quickly,
    get user feedback, 
    and improve before
     creating the full version.

     🍕 Analogy

You want to build a car.

You don't give the user:

❌ Engine
❌ Wheels
❌ Seats separately

Instead you give:

✔️ A skateboard → to test basic movement
✔️ Then cycle
✔️ Then bike
✔️ Then car

Each step is usable.
